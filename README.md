## How to play

- ⬅️ Left Arrow: move left
- ➡️ Right Arrow: move right
- ⬆️ Up Arrow: rotate
- ⬇️ Down Arrow: soft drop (faster fall)

Goal: Fill a row completely to clear it and score points. The game ends when pieces stack to the top.

Tips
- Click inside the game first so the arrow keys work.
- If pieces fall too fast, tap ⬇️ briefly instead of holding it down.
- If you see text/code instead of the game, you opened `README.md` by mistake—open `tetris.html`.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Keys don’t work: Click the game area once to focus the window, then try the arrows again.
- Blank/white screen: Make sure you opened `tetris.html` in a web browser (not a text editor).
- macOS won’t open the file: Control‑click `tetris.html` → Open.
- Game looks too big/small: Use your browser zoom (Cmd/Ctrl + or −).
- Security warning about local files: It’s a local HTML page; choose Keep/Open.
