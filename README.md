# 🎮 Tetris 


A **simple yet fun** Tetris game written entirely in **one file** — combining **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. 

This project is desined for anyone who wants to learn how to build a basic web-based game using Cursor and Cursor Rules.

## 🛠 Game Features that we will build in the process 

- **Classic Tetris Gameplay**: Rotate, move, and drop Tetrominoes to clear rows and score points.
- **Minimalist Design**: Clean and simple UI.
- **Fully Functional in One File**: All the logic, styles, and visuals packed into a single `.html` file.
- **Responsive Controls**: Use arrow keys to control the game.
- **Lightweight and Fun**: No frameworks, no dependencies — just pure JavaScript magic! ✨

## 🚀 How to Play (Controls)

1. **Open the Game**: Open `tetris.html` in any modern browser. 
2. **Controls**:
   - ⬅️ **Left Arrow**: Move Tetromino left.
   - ➡️ **Right Arrow**: Move Tetromino right.
   - ⬆️ **Up Arrow**: Rotate Tetromino.
   - ⬇️ **Down Arrow**: Drop Tetromino faster.

3. **Objective**: Fill rows completely to clear them and score points. Keep the board as clear as possible to avoid game over!

## 💡 What I Learned

- **Game Logic**: Handling Tetromino sequences, rotations, and collisions.
- **Canvas API**: Rendering the game board and Tetrominoes dynamically.
- **Randomization**: Generating random Tetromino sequences for gameplay.
- **Key Events**: Using `keydown` events for smooth and responsive controls.
